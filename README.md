# .NET Developer Training - Projects

 ## General Objective


his repository documents my technical and architectural evolution throughout the **.NET Developer Training** program at Digital Innovation One.

Rather than simply delivering the proposed exercises, each project was approached as a production-oriented scenario. The goal was not only to implement the requested features, but to intentionally refine structure, improve maintainability, and apply real-world architectural principles.

Throughout the modules, I consistently revisited previous concepts and integrated them into newer projects. This means that later implementations often include refinements such as improved layering, separation of concerns, dependency injection, standardized API responses, structured error handling, and automated testing strategies — even when these were not explicitly required.

The objective of this repository is to demonstrate:

-   Technical consistency across multiple projects
    
-   Progressive improvement in design decisions
    
-   Attention to code organization, readability, and scalability
    
-   Clear documentation of technical reasoning
    

Each project folder contains the source code as well as a dedicated README explaining the design decisions, improvements applied beyond the original requirements, and possible future enhancements.

This repository serves not only as a record of completed coursework, but as a structured portfolio that reflects professional growth within the .NET ecosystem.

## Repository Structure
Each directory represents a training module and contains both implementation and documentation:
